# Final-Year-Project
## A Comparison of Features Learned on Natural Vs. Drawn Image Datasets

This is my final year project for the degree of Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London. This project was 

The machine leanrning framework **Torch 7** and  **Ubuntu 14.1** are the prerequisite working environment.

### Step 1: Get to know about VGG and deep neural network

In this part of work, I got to learned about the basic knowledge about the structure of a deep nerual network via the example of VGG. A simple classification task by VGG was performed.
